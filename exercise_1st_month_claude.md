# 📝 Important Notes

### On Pull-Up Progression
The negative pull-ups are doing the real work. Don't get frustrated if full pull-ups take time. Going from "can't do a dead hang pull-up" to "3-4 clean reps" in a month is realistic and excellent progress.

### On the Shoulder
If at any point you feel that pinching sensation again:
- Back off pull work for a few days
- Increase the prehab exercises
- Better to lose a few days than a few months

### On Lower Body Soreness
Since you've neglected lower body, expect significant soreness in weeks 1-2, especially from Bulgarian split squats. This is normal and will settle. Your legs will catch up relatively quickly.

### On Rest
With your improved sleep and nutrition, you'll recover well. But if you feel beat up, take an extra rest day. Three quality sessions beat five mediocre ones.

### On Progression After Week 4
- Add a backpack with books for weighted push-ups
- Continue progressing pull-up volume
- Explore pike push-up progressions (feet elevated)
- Add tempo work (slower eccentrics)
- Consider adding resistance bands to water bottle exercises

---

*Good luck with your training! Consistency beats intensity. Show up, do the work, and the results will follow.* 💪
